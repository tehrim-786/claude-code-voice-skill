# /call

Voice conversations with Claude (Opus 4.5) about your projects.

## Quick Start

```bash
# One-time setup
pip install claude-code-voice
claude-code-voice setup              # Add API key, phone, name

# Register a project
cd your-project
claude-code-voice register

# Start receiving calls (does everything automatically)
claude-code-voice start
```

That's it! Now you can:
- **Outbound**: Run `claude-code-voice call` to have Claude call you
- **Inbound**: Call the Vapi number shown and Claude answers with your project loaded

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `setup` | Configure Vapi API key, your phone number, and name |
| `register` | Register current directory as a project |
| `start` | **Easy mode** - starts server + tunnel, configures everything |
| `call [topic]` | Have Claude call you about current/recent project |
| `status` | Check if everything is configured |
| `config name <name>` | Update your name for greetings |

## Features

### Personalized Greetings
Claude greets you by name: *"Hey Sarah! I've got my-project loaded up."*

Set your name during setup or update it:
```bash
claude-code-voice config name YourName
```

### Live Project Context
During calls, Claude can:
- Read your files
- Search your code
- Check git status
- See recent changes

### Auto-Sync Transcripts
Transcripts automatically save to `~/.claude/skills/call/data/transcripts/` when calls end.

## How It Works

1. **Setup** stores your Vapi API key and creates voice tools
2. **Register** snapshots your project context (git status, recent files, etc.)
3. **Start** runs a local server + tunnel so Vapi can reach your code
4. **Calls** use Opus 4.5 with your project context preloaded

## Requirements

- Vapi account with API key (https://dashboard.vapi.ai)
- Vapi phone number (purchase in dashboard ~$2/month)
- Node.js (for localtunnel)

## Troubleshooting

### Call doesn't connect
```bash
claude-code-voice status  # Check configuration
```

### Claude can't access files during call
Make sure `claude-code-voice start` is running in a terminal.

### "I don't recognize this number"
Call from the phone number you used during setup.

## Manual Setup (Advanced)

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
claude-code-voice server

# Terminal 2: Start tunnel
npx localtunnel --port 8765

# Configure the tunnel URL
claude-code-voice config server-url https://xxx.loca.lt
claude-code-voice configure-inbound
```
